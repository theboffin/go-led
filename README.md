LED Scrolling Banner for GO

Written to continue my exploration and learning of the GO language. Please note with this repo, I am EXTREMELY NEW to GO.  While this demo does work, and seems to work well, it's written by a GO novice, and as and when my GO skills improve i'll refactor this.

This is a console mode application.  For controlling console i/o I use https://github.com/rivo/tview/wiki 

The idea here is to display a string of text, scrolling (initially) from right-left in a simulated LED scrolling display using coloured characters to simulate LEDs being lit and LEDs that are not lit.

This may be enhanced to allow piping text to it from the command line;  as well as other controls for speed, direction, colour and size.
